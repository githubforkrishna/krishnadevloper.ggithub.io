                      <p>  Opinion pieces have
                           their place in the content world, 
                           but cold hard facts tend to resonate with 
                           readers. Data and statistics lend weight and credibility 
                           to your authority, increasing readers’ trust in you and your content.
                          Where possible, back up your claims with facts and
                          stats from credible sources throughout your posts. 
                          You can also publish fact sheets—a type of post that’s
                          especially appealing to readers who love to read small, 
                          digestible pieces of information all in one place.
